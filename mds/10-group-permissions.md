The string `"-rw-rw-r--"` represents the file permissions of a file in a Unix-like operating system (such as Linux or macOS). In the Unix file permission system, permissions are represented by ten characters: the first character indicates the file type, and the remaining nine characters represent the file's permissions.

Here's what each character in `"-rw-rw-r--"` means:

`-`: This indicates that the file is a regular file. If it were a directory, this character would be replaced by a `d`.

`rw-`: These three characters represent the permissions for the file's owner. In this case, the owner has read `(r)` and write `(w)` permissions, but no execute `(x)` permission.

`rw-`: These three characters represent the permissions for the file's group. Like the owner, the group also has read and write permissions, but no execute permission.

`r--`: These three characters represent the permissions for others (users who are neither the owner nor in the group). Others have only read permission.

So, in summary, the file "-rw-rw-r--" is a regular file with read and write permissions for the owner and the group, and read-only permission for others.
