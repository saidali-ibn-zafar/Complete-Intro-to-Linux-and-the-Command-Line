# vim

Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing.

To open a file in Vim, open your terminal and type:

```bash
vim filename
```

### quiting vim

- `Esc` to ensure you're in Normal Mode.

- `:` to enter Command Mode.

- `q` followed by Enter to quit (or `q!` if you want to quit without saving).

### deleting all the lines inside the vim

- Press `Esc` to ensure you're in Normal Mode.

- Type `gg` to move the cursor to the beginning of the file.

- Type `dG` to delete all lines from the cursor position to the end of the file.

### less 

- `less` is a command-line program used to view the contents of a text file in a terminal window. It allows us to navigate through the file, search for specific text, and perform other operations without modifying the original file.

-  `Scrolling:` We can scroll up and down through the file using the arrow keys or other navigation keys.

- `Search:` We can search for specific text within the file by typing / followed by the text we want to search for and then pressing Enter.

- `Navigation:` We can move to the beginning or end of the file by pressing g for the start of the file and G for the end of the file.

- `Page Navigation:` We can move forward one page by pressing the Spacebar and move backward one page by pressing b.

- `Quit:` We can exit less by pressing q.
