# curl


`curl` is another command-line utility used for transferring data from or to a server. It supports various protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, LDAP, and more. Like `wget`, it is commonly used in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux.

```bash
curl [OPTIONS] [URL]

```


For example, to download a file named example.zip from a website, we would use:

```bash
curl  https://example.com/example.zip

```
